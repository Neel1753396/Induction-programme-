### DAY-1
## 30 August
The first day of my college life began with a peaceful and spiritual start. We attended a Shabad Kirtan at Guru Sahib, and it really set a calm and positive tone for the day. After that, we were treated to a tea party where we casually interacted with other freshers and began getting comfortable in this new environment.

Next, we all headed to the auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. The event was hosted by Tarnveer Kaur, who kept the flow going smoothly. Harsimran ma'am then gave us a short but informative talk about the college’s background and achievements over the years. One of the former professors also spoke and shared some really thoughtful quotes that left a mark on many of us.

The chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, gave a heartfelt speech. He shared some personal memories related to the college and even mentioned his older brother who had completed his B.Tech from here. Our principal then addressed us, speaking with a lot of warmth and encouraging us to make the most of our time here. He emphasized the importance of feeling at home in a new place, which was comforting to hear.

After a short break, we were guided to our respective departments based on our chosen branches. It was great to see the campus more closely and meet some of the faculty. That marked the end of Day 1.

## 01 August

Today was my second day at college, and it was full of interesting things.

The day started with a lecture by Dr. Priya Darshani. She talked about human values and told us how our efforts can bring happiness and success. She explained the difference between things we need for the body and things that help us understand life better.

Then we had a surprise! We learned about the Satya Scholarship. They showed us how to apply for it, step by step. It was nice to see that the college is helping students from the very beginning.

After that, Dr. Arvind Dhingra gave a great talk. He is the director of STEP and head of TAC. His words were very inspiring, and he gave us good advice that we will remember.

After a short break, we had two tests—one in English and one in Maths. The tests were a bit difficult, but they helped us see how much we know.

The day ended well, and I felt proud. I’m excited for what’s coming next in college.

My Third Day of College

Our third day of college started with a session by the Causmic Club in the auditorium. We were told that this club was started in 2025 to plan and manage college events and activities. They also gave us a short and helpful tutorial on how to make a GitHub account and upload our projects there. Many of us found it new and interesting.

After that, we had a session on Human Resource Values by Dr. Priya Darshani ma’am. She continued the topic from her last class and explained more about it. The information was useful, but the session was a bit long, and honestly, some students started to feel a little bored.

After the break, we had our first proper subject classes. The first one was English, taught by Prof. Nisha. It was a fun and interactive class. Everyone got a chance to introduce themselves, and she also shared some grammar tips to help us speak more confidently.

The last class of the day was a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) session. Our seniors taught us the basics of the C++ programming language. They also gave us small code examples to try on our laptops using a compiler. This made the session more practical and interesting.

And that’s how our third day at college ended—full of new things to learn and fun experience.
