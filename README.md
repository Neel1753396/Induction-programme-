### DAY-1
## 30 August
The first day of my college life began with a peaceful and spiritual start. We attended a Shabad Kirtan at Guru Sahib, and it really set a calm and positive tone for the day. After that, we were treated to a tea party where we casually interacted with other freshers and began getting comfortable in this new environment.

Next, we all headed to the auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. The event was hosted by Tarnveer Kaur, who kept the flow going smoothly. Harsimran ma'am then gave us a short but informative talk about the college’s background and achievements over the years. One of the former professors also spoke and shared some really thoughtful quotes that left a mark on many of us.

The chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, gave a heartfelt speech. He shared some personal memories related to the college and even mentioned his older brother who had completed his B.Tech from here. Our principal then addressed us, speaking with a lot of warmth and encouraging us to make the most of our time here. He emphasized the importance of feeling at home in a new place, which was comforting to hear.

After a short break, we were guided to our respective departments based on our chosen branches. It was great to see the campus more closely and meet some of the faculty. That marked the end of Day 1.

## 01 August

Today was my second day at college, and it was full of interesting things.

The day started with a lecture by Dr. Priya Darshani. She talked about human values and told us how our efforts can bring happiness and success. She explained the difference between things we need for the body and things that help us understand life better.

Then we had a surprise! We learned about the Satya Scholarship. They showed us how to apply for it, step by step. It was nice to see that the college is helping students from the very beginning.

After that, Dr. Arvind Dhingra gave a great talk. He is the director of STEP and head of TAC. His words were very inspiring, and he gave us good advice that we will remember.

After a short break, we had two tests—one in English and one in Maths. The tests were a bit difficult, but they helped us see how much we know.

The day ended well, and I felt proud. I’m excited for what’s coming next in college.

My Third Day of College

Our third day of college started with a session by the Causmic Club in the auditorium. We were told that this club was started in 2025 to plan and manage college events and activities. They also gave us a short and helpful tutorial on how to make a GitHub account and upload our projects there. Many of us found it new and interesting.

After that, we had a session on Human Resource Values by Dr. Priya Darshani ma’am. She continued the topic from her last class and explained more about it. The information was useful, but the session was a bit long, and honestly, some students started to feel a little bored.

After the break, we had our first proper subject classes. The first one was English, taught by Prof. Nisha. It was a fun and interactive class. Everyone got a chance to introduce themselves, and she also shared some grammar tips to help us speak more confidently.

The last class of the day was a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) session. Our seniors taught us the basics of the C++ programming language. They also gave us small code examples to try on our laptops using a compiler. This made the session more practical and interesting.

And that’s how our third day at college ended—full of new things to learn and fun experience.

## 5 August
The fourth day at college began with an unexpected twist. As I arrived in the afternoon, buzzing with excitement for the day ahead, the schedule suddenly changed just before the first lecture in the auditorium. Amidst the confusion, each branch was directed to their respective allotted classrooms where our seniors awaited us eagerly. In our hour-long class session, we introduced ourselves one by one, breaking the ice and getting to know our peers. Our seniors enlightened us about various club activities and upcoming events, setting the tone for our college journey.

Later, we gathered again in the auditorium for a captivating lecture by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar on the wonders of millets as a superfood. The atmosphere was engaging, with Mrs. Makkar delving into the nutritional benefits of millets, emphasizing their protein content and sharing insights into their culinary history. Her interactive approach encouraged many students, including myself, to actively participate, making the lecture both informative and enjoyable.

The day concluded with a sense of camaraderie and newfound knowledge about millets, leaving us eager for more enriching experiences in the days to come. As a college fresher, each day brings new surprises and opportunities for learning, and I look forward to embracing all that this journey has to offer.

As the fifth day of our induction program unfolded, we were greeted with a diverse array of insightful sessions and engaging lectures. The day commenced with a stimulating lecture by Dr. Parminder Singh, the Dean of Student Welfare, where we delved into the dynamic world of clubs and their activities. We learned about the upcoming youth festivals and how these platforms foster creativity and collaboration among students.

Following this, Mr. Manpreet Singh, a fitness expert, took the stage, enlightening us on the importance of physical well-being tailored specifically for engineers. His session was not just informative but also interactive, with many fitness enthusiasts eagerly posing questions about protein intake, managing sugar levels, and understanding the psychology of fitness.

After a rejuvenating break, we transitioned to our first physics lecture conducted by Prof. Jaspreet Singh. He introduced us to the foundational aspects of physics and outlined the semester's syllabus, focusing particularly on the intriguing realm of electromagnetism, which will be our initial exploration. His explanation of key terminologies and concepts sparked our curiosity and set a promising tone for the semester ahead.

Later in the day, we attended a session on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) learning, where we received a comprehensive introduction to the basics of C++. The classes concluded with a sense of accomplishment as we absorbed fundamental knowledge that will undoubtedly form the bedrock of our technical journey in the coming years.
